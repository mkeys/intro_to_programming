BDW - INTRO TO PROGRAMMING - Morgan Keys
==============================================

This is a repository of everything I've created during my first semester of Intro to Programming at BDW.  Big shout out to Jay Zeschin and Collin Schaafsma for teaching me even as I quietly banged my head against the keyboard.

1. morgan_goals
	- This is the first thing I ever created in Ruby.  It's pretty simple, just a collection of puts statements about what I wanted to achieve in this class.

2. stain
	- After learning about variables and how to use the terminal as a calculator, I wrote this to figure out how much stain it would take to cover the tables at BDW.  Twice.

3. countdown
	- Using the Time class, I wrote this code that caluculates how many months, days, hours, minutes and seconds left until the new year (supposing, of course, we all survive that whole Mayan, doomsday thing).  What's that, you're a dog?  Okay, I'll calculate that too.

4. kickstarter-calc
	- In order to find out how much money the guys at Kickstarter have made, I used Date classes and variables.

5. kitchen
	- As a gentle introduction to methods, this program uses booleans, variables, arrays and if statements to calculate how much time my kitchen gets used to make breakfast.  It also tells me how healthy I am based on how much butter is used.  And I even put aside time to make a cup of coffee for you.  You're welcome.

6. soda_machine
	- After learning about hashes and loops, I wrote this soda machine program that lets you buy or reload beverages.

7. blackjack
	- In order to simulate a real-life Blackjack game, I wrote a lot of code.  I mean really, a lot.  It works, mostly, but needed to be simplified...

8. blackjack_final
	- ...so I am currently attempting to use objects and classes to rewrite a better Blackjack game.  It's a work in progress, but I am committed to understanding the concept and finishing the project.  Check back soon for progress, I promise!
